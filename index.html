      <p>After graduating from the University of Portland I went to work for my families business in the wine industry. For the past 10 years I have started, grown, and managed our custom wine sales division. As someone who likes to be challenged, enjoys learning, and who is very entrepreneurial, I enjoyed growing that side of our business. In 2016 I started a coffee roasting business as a sort of passion project. While I learned  many things from that venture, most importantly I learned that it is not what I wanted to do long term. <br>

    <br>One area I have always been interested in, but not formally educated in, is coding. When I saw that there was a bootcamp at DU I felt the opportunity was too good to pass up. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do with it, but I do know that I am going to learn as much as possible and keep an open mind about my future. I have been studying and practicing daily for the past two months and I'm really enjoying all of the learning. At the end of the class I hope to follow my heart and find employment in whatever area seems most enjoyable and exciting.
